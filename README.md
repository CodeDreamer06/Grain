# Why I built grain
_(and why it matters, even if nothing else does)_

When I failed JEE for the last time, I wasn’t just grieving a test. I was mourning a **version of myself** I thought I’d become.  

In that stillness, when motivation became meaningless, I realized something quieter might survive ambition: **ritual**.

  

*grain* is not a productivity app. It’s a **companion** for the slow, deliberate act of continuing. It runs in your terminal. It doesn’t sync. It doesn’t push notifications or pretend to be your friend.

It just counts—**one hour, one credit at a time**.

You earn **90 credits a week**. Surplus becomes your break time. There are no hacks, no gamification. Just the **quiet math** of effort and rest.


Because when everything else falls apart, the only question worth answering is: _can I still show up?_

  

And **grain** answers, without fanfare: **yes. once more.**

## Philosophy

Grain isn’t built for optimization—it’s built for intention. It treats focus as a **ritual**, not a race.

At its core is a quiet loop:

1. **Log:** Record your study or break credits with minimal friction.

2. **Read:** Review your daily or weekly patterns.

3. **Reflect:** Adjust your rhythm—when to lean in, and when to pause.

No sync, no noise. Just your effort, your data, and a clean terminal interface that stays out of your way.
## Installation

1.  **Ensure Go is installed:** You need Go (version 1.18 or later recommended). Check with `go version`.
2.  **Clone the repository (replace with actual URL when available):**
    ```bash
    # git clone https://github.com/your-username/grain.git 
    # cd grain
    # For now, assume you are in the project directory
    ```
3.  **Build the binary:**
    ```bash
    go build -o grain .
    ```
    This creates the `grain` executable in the current directory.
4.  **Move to PATH (Optional but recommended):**
    Move the compiled `grain` binary to a directory in your system's `$PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`) for easy access from anywhere.
    ```bash
    # Example for macOS/Linux:
    # sudo mv grain /usr/local/bin/ 
    # Or choose a user-specific path:
    # mkdir -p ~/bin && mv grain ~/bin # Ensure ~/bin is in your PATH
    ```

## First Run

The first time you run `grain` (or any `grain` command), it will check for `~/.grain/config.json`. If not found, it will prompt you for initial setup:

```txt
👋 Welcome to Grain CLI!

Enter your study goal per week (default: 90): 90
Set initial break credits (default: 12): 12
✨ Configuration saved to /Users/yourname/.grain/config.json
```

This creates `~/.grain/config.json` and `~/.grain/data.json` (initially empty or with default stats).

## Usage

Grain uses simple commands for core actions.

### Logging Credits

*   `grain`: Logs **+1 study credit** (default action).
*   `grain <N>`: Logs **+N study credits** (e.g., `grain 3`).
*   `grain s [N]`: Logs **+N study credits** (e.g., `grain s` or `grain s 2`). `N` defaults to 1 if omitted.
*   `grain b [N]`: Logs **-N break credits** (e.g., `grain b` or `grain b 5`). `N` defaults to 1 if omitted.
    *   *Constraint:* You cannot log more break credits than currently available for the week.

**Example Output:**

```bash
grain 3
```
```txt
✨ +3 study credits logged. Keep it rolling!
```

```bash
grain b
```
```txt
🍵 -1 break credit logged. Breathe easy.
```

### Viewing Data

*   `grain log`: View today's log entries.
    ```txt
    🗓️  Log for Jul 15
    ────────────────────────────
    [09:30] +2 study
    [11:05] +1 study
    [14:00] -1 break
    
    Total ▸ 🧠 3 study   💤 1 break
    ```
*   `grain week`: View the current weekly overview (Monday-Sunday, excluding Sunday logs).
    ```txt
    📊 Week of Jul 15
    ────────────────────────────
    🧠 Study     ▸ 74 / 90
    💤 Breaks    ▸ 4 / 12
    ✨ Surplus   ▸ 0
    🔥 Streak    ▸ 4 weeks
    ```
*   `grain stats`: Show overall historical statistics.
    ```txt
    📈 Your Stats
    ────────────────────────────
    🔁 Streak:         4 weeks
    🏆 Best Surplus:   +18
    📚 Total Study:    210 credits
    🍵 Total Breaks:   35 credits
    🧾 Total Entries:  85
    ```

### Actions & Management

*   `grain undo`: Reverts the **last logged action** (study or break) and updates stats.
    ```txt
    🔙 Undid log: [14:00] -1 break
    Remaining undo steps: 8
    ```
*   `grain config`: Opens `~/.grain/config.json` in your system's default editor. It respects the `$EDITOR` environment variable or falls back to `vim`, `nano`, or `code` if found.
    ```txt
    Attempting to open /Users/yourname/.grain/config.json with vim...
    Editor closed. Configuration changes will be applied the next time you run grain.
    ```
*   `grain reset`: Prompts to **delete all log entries for the current week** (Monday-Sunday). Requires confirmation by typing `reset grain`.
    ```txt
    ⚠️  Are you sure you want to reset this week's data?
    Type "reset grain" to confirm: reset grain
    🧹 Current week data has been reset.
    ```
*   `grain backup`: Creates a timestamped backup of `data.json` in the `~/.grain/backups/` directory.
    ```txt
    🗃️ Backup saved to: ~/.grain/backups/backup_2024-07-15_10-30-00.json
    ```
*   `grain restore <filename.json>`: Replaces the current `data.json` with the contents of a specific backup file from the `~/.grain/backups/` directory. Requires confirmation by typing `yes`.
    ```bash
    grain restore backup_2024-07-15_10-30-00.json
    ```
    ```txt
    ⚠️ This will overwrite current data with the contents of 'backup_2024-07-15_10-30-00.json'.
    Type "yes" to confirm: yes
    ♻️ Data restored from backup_2024-07-15_10-30-00.json and current stats recalculated.
    ```

## Data Storage

All application data is stored locally within the `~/.grain/` directory:

*   `~/.grain/config.json`: User configuration (weekly goal, break start). Edit via `grain config` or manually.
*   `~/.grain/data.json`: Contains all log entries (`logs`), weekly surplus history (`weekly_surplus`), current streak (`streak`), best surplus ever (`best_surplus`), and the undo stack (`undo_stack`).
*   `~/.grain/backups/`: Stores timestamped JSON backups created with `grain backup`.

## Core Logic Summary

*   **Weekly Goal:** Set in `config.json` (default `90`). This is the target number of *study* credits per week.
*   **Break Credits:** You start each week (Monday) with a base number of break credits set in `config.json` (default `12`).
*   **Surplus Bonus:** If your total *study* credits for the week exceed the `weekly_goal`, each extra study credit earns you **+2** additional break credits *for that week*. Surplus = `(StudyCredits - WeeklyGoal) * 2`.
*   **Break Cap:** Available break credits at the start of the week are capped by `break_start` in the config. Surplus earned during the week can increase this.
*   **Weekly Cycle:** Weeks run Monday to Sunday. Stats like available breaks and goal progress reset on Monday. **Logging is disabled on Sundays.**
*   **Streak:** Tracks the number of *consecutive previous weeks* where the `weekly_goal` for study credits was met or exceeded.
*   **Undo:** Uses a stack (`undo_stack` in `data.json`) to allow reversing log actions infinitely.

## Development

*   Uses Go standard library and `github.com/spf13/cobra` for CLI structure.
*   Build: `go build -o grain .`
*   Format: `go fmt ./...`
*   Tidy dependencies: `go mod tidy`
*   Run tests (if any added): `go test ./...`
